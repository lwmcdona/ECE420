# Notes
  * This submission contains a few different solutions from different steps as we optimized. They can be found in main1-main3. The most heavily optimized version of the
      code can be found in main.c

# Steps to Run
  1. Unzip the downloaded folder
  2. Use the MakeFile to compile the necessary files (`make` to compile the main implementation of one of main1. main2. main3 etc. to use other implementations)
  3. Generate a node set to solve with `make datatrim` and then `./datatrim`
  4. Run the Page Rank algorithm by running `mpirun  -np <num_threads> ./main`
