# Notes
  * This submission contains a few different solutions from different steps as we optimized. They can be found in main1-main5. The most heavily optimized version of the
      code can be found in main.c

# Steps to Run
  1. Unzip the downloaded folder
  2. Use the MakeFile to compile the necessary files (`make` to compile the main implementation of one of main1. main2. main3 etc. to use other implementations)
  3. Generate a matrix to solve with `make datagen` and then `./datagen`
  4. Run the Gauss-Jordan elimination by running `./main <number of threads`
